For this project I used to deck of cards api in an attempt to create the card game hearts. My initial approach to this project was, admittedly, wrong from the start. I needed to take more time in the design phase instead of jumping straight into coding. I went ahead and wrote a lot of functions that I would need but I went about testing them is ways that made it harder to implement the proper game logic later on without re writing a large portion of code. 
Unsolved Problems: Most of the internal game logic. Dealing with turns, counting points gained from a trick, Formating on the web page (specifically how the cards in the east and west hands display on screen) formating the player hand in a sequential manner. Checking for legality of moves both from the player and AI, Implementing a TRAM (or The Rest Are Mine) check to speed up gameplay. Checking game end conditions (when a player gains more than 100 points). Dealing with the situation of when a player 'Shoots the Moon' (takes all 26 points in a round).
