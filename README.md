For this project I used to deck of cards api in an attempt to create the card game hearts. My initial approach to this project was, admittedly, wrong from the start. I needed to take more time in the design phase instead of jumping straight into coding. I went ahead and wrote a lot of functions that I would need but I went about testing them is ways that made it harder to implement the proper game logic later on without re writing a large portion of code.
